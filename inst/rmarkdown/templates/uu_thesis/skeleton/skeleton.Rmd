# About this Thesis Template {-}

Welcome to the thesis template. This template is based on the huwiwidown template package.

## Why use R Markdown? {-}

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX
to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. 

_R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to
visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and
commentary on the results of your project. Using _R Markdown_ will also allow
you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the 
resulting plots and output included as well.
