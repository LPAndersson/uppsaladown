# Abstract {-}

This is the template for a thesis at the Chair of Econometrics of
Humboldt--Universität zu Berlin. A popular approach to write a thesis or a
paper is the IMRAD method (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion). This
approach is not mandatory! You can find more information about formal
requirements in the booklet `Hinweise zur Gestaltung der äußeren Form von
Diplomarbeiten' which is available in the office of studies.
 
The abstract should not be longer than a paragraph of around 10-15 lines (or
about 150 words). The abstract should contain a concise description of the
econometric/economic problem you analyze and of your results. This allows the
busy reader to obtain quickly a clear idea of the thesis content.
